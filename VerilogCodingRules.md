# Verilog Coding rules

### 1. The "Always" Rule

* **Rule:** If a signal is on the **left** side of an assignment inside an `always` block, it **MUST** be a `reg`.
* **Reason:** The `always` block implies "procedure" or "memory," so the variable must hold its value until the next update.

### 2. The "Assign" Rule

* **Rule:** If a signal is on the **left** side of an `assign` statement, it **MUST** be a `wire`.
* **Reason:** `assign` creates a permanent physical connection (like soldering a wire), not a storage memory.

### 3. The "Child-to-Parent" Rule

* **Rule:** When connecting a submodule's **output** to the parent module, the parent's receiving signal **MUST** be a `wire`.
* **Reason:** The submodule is already "driving" the signal. You cannot plug a hard driver directly into a storage bucket (`reg`).

### 4. The "Wire-then-Reg" Rule (The Fix)

* **Rule:** To store a submodule's output into a `reg`, you must first catch it with a `wire` in the parent's module, then copy it to the `reg` inside an `always` block.
* **Reason:** A `reg` can only have **one master** (the `always` block). If you connected the submodule directly to the `reg`, the submodule would try to fight the `always` block for control, causing a conflict as there is a difference in **who is doing the driving (writing)** versus **who is being read**.

### 5. The "Parent-to-Child" Rule

* **Rule:** When sending a signal **into** a submodule's input, the source can be a `reg` OR a `wire`.
* **Reason:** The submodule just listens to the voltage level; it doesn't care if that voltage comes from a register or a wire.

### 6. The "Input Port" Rule

* **Rule:** Inside a module definition, an `input` port is **ALWAYS** a `wire`.
* **Reason:** You cannot write to your own input; you only read from it.

### 7. The "Output Port" Rule

* **Rule:** Inside a module definition, an `output` port can be defined as `wire` (default) OR `reg`.
* **Reason:** Use `wire` if the value comes from combinational logic (`assign`). Use `reg` if the value is calculated in an `always` block.
